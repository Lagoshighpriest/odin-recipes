            Step 1:
            Place pork roast in a slower cooker, rub with salt, and pour root beer,
            liquid smoke and garlic over the stop
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 2:
            Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours. Remove pork to a bowl. Strain liquid 
            through a fine-mesh strainer; discard liquid or save for another use (see Editor's Note).
            Add garlic cloves back to the pork. Shred pork using two forks. Serve with your favorite
            BBQ sauce.

    <p>
        This is simple slow cooker pulled pork recipe is big hit with
my family of pick eaters. For a spicy kick, mix 1 part Frank's RedHot
Buffalo sauce and 1 part of your favorite mustard-based BBQ sauce. You
can use a pork loin instead of pork shoulder, if desired. Combine with
your favorite BBQ sauce and enjoy.

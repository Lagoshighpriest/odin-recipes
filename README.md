This is simple slow cooker pulled pork recipe is big hit with
my family of pick eaters. For a spicy kick, mix 1 part Frank's RedHot
Buffalo sauce and 1 part of your favorite mustard-based BBQ sauce. You
can use a pork loin instead of pork shoulder, if desired. Combine with
your favorite BBQ sauce and enjoy.
